<h2>👨‍💻 A sneak peek at a few projects I've worked on!</h2>

- <b>Predicting Code Runtime Complexity using Static Analysis and Machine Learning</b>
  - The aim of this project is to predict the Big O Notation of a given algorithm in three different languages, C++, Java, and Python using Abstract Syntax Trees(AST), Graph Embeddings, Machine learning based classification algorithms and BiLSTM. This repo is private as of now as we are working on more improvements :)

- <b>Kinship Recognition using Siamese Networks</b>
  - This project aimed to analyze whether two people are related by blood or not through their facial pictures using Siamese Networks. Tech included Python, Tensorflow 2.0, and Matplotlib

- <b>COVID Data Analysis and Information Retrieval</b>
  - This project aimed to recommend new insights to bolster the fight against COVID by generating new insights to keep up with the acceleration of literature related to the disease

- <b>Predicting Student Assessment Marks to Prevent Student Attrition in MOOCs</b>
  - The aim is to predict the student's score, rather than just predicting if he/she will pass or fail the course using ensemble learning techniques.

- <b>Deploying CRUD operations based Flask Application using Microservices based Architecture </b>
  - Docker and Kubernetes are almost synonymous to 'microservices' as they help package and manage the different components of a project/ application, thereby easing up the implementation of a microservices architecture.

- <b>San Francisco Crime Classification using Pyspark</b>
  - This project aimed to classify crime using incremental Learning and streaming techniques to train models based on new data encountered using Python, and Pyspark.

- <b>I Feel U</b>
  - This was a mood-based song recommender in which facial emotion detection is done using a Convolutional Neural Network, Transfer Learning, and the songs from Spotify are recommended accordingly using Python, Tensorflow 2.0, and Matplotlib.

- <b>Art Gallery Management System</b>
  - As a part of Database Management Systems, this project aimed to build a PSQL database to manage various aspects of an art gallery with a Python-based user interface using PSQL, and Python.

- <b>MoodBoost</b>
  - As a part of Georgia Institue of Technology Hackathon,  we built a streamlit application to help individuals improve their mental health during the Covid-19 crisis.

- <b>Coral reefs and how they have degraded over the years</b>
  - This project aimed to visualize and draw insights from the Coral reef Temperature Anomaly Database data using Tableau

- <b>Outreach - A website connecting developers </b>
  - This website is built using MERN stack. The users can register and login, and create their own profile, by including their education, job-experience, social medial handles and so on. There's also a functionality to put up posts and also delete them, if the user doesn't want them anymore. Other users can comment, like and unlike these posts and can have discussions too.
