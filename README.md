<h1>Hey there, I'm Deepa! 
<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª A sneak peek at a few projects I've worked on!</h2>

- <b>Catalog Indexing Engine</b>
  - This project employs microservices based architecture and supports both structured and unstructured queries to retrive information from fashion catalogs, displaying the most relevant products to end users, with the aid of machine learning techniques
  - <b><i>(https://github.com/BFB-PES/Catalog-Indexing-Engine)</b></i>

- <b>Predicting Code Runtime Complexity using Static Analysis and Machine Learning</b>
  - The aim of this project is to predict the Big O Notation of a given algorithm in three different languages, C++, Java, and Python using Abstract Syntax Trees(AST), Graph Embeddings, Machine learning based classification algorithms and BiLSTM. This repo is private as of now as we are working on more improvements :)

- <b>Kinship Recognition using Siamese Networks</b>
  - This project aimed to analyze whether two people are related by blood or not through their facial pictures using Siamese Networks. Tech included Python, Tensorflow 2.0, and Matplotlib
  - <b><i> (https://github.com/Pravena725/Kinship-Recognition)</b></i>

- <b>COVID Data Analysis and Information Retrieval</b>
  - This project aimed to recommend new insights to bolster the fight against COVID by generating new insights to keep up with the acceleration of literature related to the disease
  - <b><i>(https://github.com/deepa-cv/AIWIR_project)</b></i>
  
- <b>Predicting Student Assessment Marks to Prevent Student Attrition in MOOCs</b>
  - The aim is to predict the student's score, rather than just predicting if he/she will pass or fail the course using ensemble learning techniques.
  - <b><i> (https://github.com/deepa-cv/Prevent-Student-Attriton) </b></i>

- <b>Deploying CRUD operations based Flask Application using Microservices based Architecture </b>
  - Docker and Kubernetes are almost synonymous to 'microservices' as they help package and manage the different components of a project/ application, thereby easing up the implementation of a microservices architecture.
  - <b><i> (https://github.com/076-096-105-106-CloudHack-1/CloudHack_1) </b></i>

- <b>San Francisco Crime Classification using Pyspark</b>
  - This project aimed to classify crime using incremental Learning and streaming techniques to train models based on new data encountered using Python, and Pyspark.
  - <b><i> (https://github.com/deepa-cv/Crime-Classification-on-streaming-data )

- <b>I Feel U</b>
  - This was a mood-based song recommender in which facial emotion detection is done using a Convolutional Neural Network, Transfer Learning, and the songs from Spotify are recommended accordingly using Python, Tensorflow 2.0, and Matplotlib.
  - <b><i> (https://github.com/Machine-Learning-Tech-Track/IFeelU) </b></i>

- <b>Art Gallery Management System</b>
  - As a part of Database Management Systems, this project aimed to build a PSQL database to manage various aspects of an art gallery with a Python-based user interface using PSQL, and Python.
  - <b><i> (https://github.com/deepa-cv/DBMS_project) </b></i>

- <b>MoodBoost</b>
  - As a part of Georgia Institue of Technology Hackathon,  we built a streamlit application to help individuals improve their mental health during the Covid-19 crisis.
  - <b><i> (https://github.com/ELITA04/Hacklytics-Streamlit) </b></i>

- <b>Coral reefs and how they have degraded over the years</b>
  - This project aimed to visualize and draw insights from the Coral reef Temperature Anomaly Database data using Tableau
  - <b><i> (https://github.com/deepa-cv/Visualising-Coral-Reef-Degradation) </b></i>

- <b>Outreach - A website connecting developers </b>
  - This website is built using MERN stack. The users can register and login, and create their own profile, by including their education, job-experience, social medial handles and so on. There's also a functionality to put up posts and also delete them, if the user doesn't want them anymore. Other users can comment, like and unlike these posts and can have discussions too.
